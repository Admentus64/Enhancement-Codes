--- ENHANCEMENT CODES ----
--------------------------

--- Setup ---

Download one of the GameINI files on this GitHub.
Codes are referred to as Enhancement Codes and listed within an .ini file.
Dolphin stores codes as part of the GameINI file which are located in the Global User Folder for Dolphin.
The Global User Directory is located on Windows by default in "\My Documents\Dolphin Emulator\GameSettings".
Just replace the .ini file in there and you are good to go.

Which GameINI do I need:
Check the GameID of your game through Dolphin.
Ex. PZLE01 is the US game disc "The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition".

Manual:
1. Open Dolphin
2 Right-click your game in Dolphin's game list
3. Click on Properties
4. Go to the Editor tab
5. Copy all content from the downloaded .ini and paste it into the User Configuration section (make sure to clear it first)

In order to use AR and Gecko Codes, make sure that the "Activate Cheats" option is enabled in Dolphin's General Config.
